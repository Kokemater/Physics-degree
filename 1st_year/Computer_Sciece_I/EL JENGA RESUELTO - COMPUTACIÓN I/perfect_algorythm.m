function [deleted_piece, placed_piece, type_of_position] = perfect_algorythm(Tower, randomness_of_the_position, randomness_of_the_mass, player)
% This functions calls to combinatorial Jenga in case the position is not
% too random, otherwise it calls minimax.
% INPUT:
% Tower : (n,3,4) Hypermatrix with the mass and the position of 
% all pieces.
% randomness_of_the_position : randomness in the position of pieces
% randomness_of_the_mass : randomness in the mass of pieces
% player : type of player (maximizer or minimizer)
% OUTPUT:
% deleted_piece : A pair [row, column] that indicates what piece to eliminate.
% placed_piece : The position of the top layer to add the piece.
% type_of_position : Indicates who is winning the game in the actual position
% it has a value of 1 if in the current Tower the first player who 
% makes a move is winning, otherwise otherwise a 2.
% USAGE:
% [deleted_piece, placed_piece, type_of_position] = perfect_algorythm(Tower, randomness_of_the_position, randomness_of_the_mass, player)
