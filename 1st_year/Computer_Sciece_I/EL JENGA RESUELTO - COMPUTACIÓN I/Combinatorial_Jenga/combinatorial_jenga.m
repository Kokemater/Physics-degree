function [deleted_piece, placed_piece,type_of_position] =  combinatorial_jenga (Tower)
% This function given the State of the tower returns the best movement
% in the game in order to win it.
% Input: 
% Tower: (n,3,4) Hypermatrix with the position and the mass of 
% all pieces
% Output: 
% type_of_position : Indicates who is winning the game in the actual position
% it has a value of 1 if in the current Tower the first player who 
% makes a move is winning, otherwise otherwise a 2.
% deleted_piece : A pair [row, column] that indicates what piece to eliminate.
% placed piece : The position of the top layer to add the piece.
% USAGE:
% [deleted_piece, placed_piece,type_of_position] =  combinatorial_jenga (Tower)

% RESTRICTIONS!!
% This algorythm takes advantage of the symetry of jenga 
% so it cannot be implemented in games with highly random 
% masses or positions. 
% So Randomness_of_the_position and Randomness_of_the_mass must be 0.

% ALGORYTHM: 
% Jenga is a combinatorial game, so we can use
% the branch of maths of combinatorial game theory
% to calculate the best move instead of using brute force.

% If we know from advanced that in some positions a player is lost
% for example, if it is the turn of Player_1 and the tower is going to fall
% no matter the piece he moves, then he is in a so called P-position 
% since Player_2 (the previus player) wins. 
% Notice all the possible states that can lead to this situation is an 
% N-position, since the next player can move to this P-position and win the game.
% Also notice that if a player can only move to N-positions it means that he is 
% in a P position. 
% Taking everything into account, now we only need to differenciate 
% what kinds of move we can make in a game in order to create a full table of 
% N-positions and P-positions depending on the pieces that remain in the tower. 
% Once we have the table created, if we are in a N-position we only have to
% make the move that leads our opponent to a P-position. And if we are in a P-position
% we are lost so we can only wait until the opponent make a mistake.

% To differenciate the kind of position and movements we make some assumptios:
% based on repeated observations in brute force algorithms (good_moves_minimizer.m)
% note this algorythm is exponentially faster than by using brute_force.

% [1] IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO STUDY THE RCM

% (1.1) This is because in a perfect Jenga Tower falls
% if and only if a layer loses a middle block and a side block so we can
% assume the tower will fall if we reach this state.


% [2] IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO STUDY ALL THE POSSIBLE MOVES
% If we distinct only 3 types of level: 
% top_level, half levels and full levels

% (2.1) Taking the same piece in different levels doesn't change the number 
% of aviable good moves if both levels are the from the same type.
% (2.2) The position of a placed piece at the top level does not affect the number of
% aviable good moves.
% (3.2)  Taking a pice of a right side of a full_level gives the same aviable
% good moves as taking from the left size

% (1) + (2) + (3) -> number of aviable good moves only depens on
% the number of: full rows, half rows, and last.
