function analyze(scoresheet, initial_tower)
% This function simulates a series of moves in a Jenga game, evaluating the quality 
% of each move made by players and calculating the precision of their actions.
% INPUT:
% scoresheet : vector that save the movements
% initial_tower : initial tower to analyze
% OUTPUT:
% The program is executed
% USAGE:
% analyze(scoresheet, initial_tower, rand_pos, rand_mass)
