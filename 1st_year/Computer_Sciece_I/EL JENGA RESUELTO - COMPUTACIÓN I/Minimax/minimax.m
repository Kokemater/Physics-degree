function [bestMove, bestScore] = minimax(board, depth, maximizingPlayer)
% This function make decisions in Jenga considering the stability of the 
% tower and the evaluation of possible moves.
% This function uses : 
% evaluate.m - generateMoves.m - newBoard.m - makeMove.m
% INPUT:
% board : Current state of the Jenga game board.
% depth : Maximum search depth in game tree. Controls how many levels of 
% decisions will be explored forward.
% maximizingPlayer : current player is maximizing or minimizing his score 
% in evaluating possible moves.
% OUTPUT:
% bestMove : best move found by minimax algorithm, which is determined after 
% exploring all possible combinations of movements up to the specified depth.
% BestScore : best move found. Represents the value of the board after 
% making the best move according to the minimax algorithm.
% USAGE:
% [bestMove, bestScore] = minimax(board, depth, maximizingPlayer)
