function newTower = makeMove(Tower, move)
% This function simulates a move in the Jenga game and updates the tower state 
% accordingly. It is a fundamental part of the simulation and analysis process 
% in the game of Jenga.
% INPUT:
% Tower : (n,3,4) Hypermatrix with the mass and the position of 
% all pieces.
% move : int data with the number of moves of the game
% OUTPUT:
% newTower : Tower with the movement made
% USAGE:
% newTower = makeMove(Tower, move)

% Perform move by removing the specified piece (deleted_piece) from the current 
% position and placing its mass in the new specified position (placed_position).
deleted_piece = move(1:2);
placed_position = move(3);

% Check if a new layer has been completed on the tower.
% If all three positions in the new layer are occupied by pieces 
% (that is, they are not zero), a new layer is added to the tower using the 
% add_new_level function.
